# 📈 Crypto Up/Down 5min Bot

A Python trading bot for **ETH and BTC Up/Down 5-minute markets on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com)**, powered by real-time Binance price data.

The bot uses a **Window Delta strategy** combined with micro momentum and ATR volatility filtering to identify high-confidence entries in the final seconds before each market closes.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Window Delta filter** — compares current crypto price to the period's open price (fetched from Binance); skips entries when the price is too close to the line
- **Micro momentum confirmation** — checks the direction of the last 2 × 1-minute candles to reinforce the signal
- **ATR volatility filter** — skips entries when the current period's range exceeds 1.5× the historical average (too volatile)
- **Composite confidence score** — normalized 0–100% signal strength; configurable minimum threshold
- **Direction alignment check** — Binance trend must match the Polymarket leading side before entering
- **Per-crypto price thresholds** — stricter entry price for BTC (≥ 0.94) than ETH (≥ 0.92)
- **Three run modes** — Paper (simulated), Live (real funds), Dry Run (real data, no execution)
- **Parallel data fetching** — Polymarket and Binance queries run concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **Session summary** — prints a full trade log on exit (Ctrl+C)

## 🧠 Strategy

Every 5 minutes Polymarket resolves whether ETH (or BTC) closed **Up** or **Down** relative to its price at the start of the period.

The bot wakes up ~65 seconds before each market close and begins monitoring. It only places a bet when **all** of the following conditions are met:

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| **Entry window** | Between 10 and 50 seconds before close |
| **PM price** | Polymarket CLOB mid-price ≥ `PRICE_MIN` and ≤ 0.99 |
| **Window Delta** | `\|current − open\| / open` > 0.05% (not too close to the line) |
| **Confidence** | Composite score ≥ 30% (configurable) |
| **Direction match** | Binance delta direction == Polymarket leading side |
| **ATR** | Current period range ≤ 1.5× historical ATR |

### Score Weighting

| Delta magnitude | Weight |
|---|---|
| > 1.0% | 7 |
| > 0.20% | 5 |
| > 0.10% | 3 |
| > 0.05% | 1 |
| Momentum confirms | +2 |
| **Max possible** | **9** |

Confidence = `abs(score) / 9.0`, capped at 100%.
